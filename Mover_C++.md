# Mover in C++

This tutorial is an extension to the [Mover tutorial here](Mover.md). In that tutorial we took a very high-level overview of the Mover sample game and identified the most important elements and concepts. If you've not already read it, you may wish to do that before proceeding here. 

This tutorial focuses on looking at the code and explaining how the code works with respect to those higher-level concepts examined previously.
